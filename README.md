Fraud Mask Detection System 

Movie Recommendor System


ðŸ§  1. Fraud Mask Detection System
This project uses OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model to perform real-time face mask detection through a webcam feed. It identifies faces and classifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The system was built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and a CNN-based architecture. It can be deployed in public places to monitor compliance with health safety protocols.


ðŸŽ¬ 2. Movie Recommender System
This project is a hybrid movie recommender system built using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and ipywidgets. It combines content-based filtering (using TF-IDF and cosine similarity on movie titles) and collaborative filtering (based on user ratings) to suggest relevant movies to users. An interactive search bar dynamically suggests movies as the user types, and the system also recommends films liked by similar users. This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, vectorization, and user behavior analysis can be combined to build an intelligent recommendation engine.
